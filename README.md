# AML_Bot - Stable Diffusion Telegram Bot

AML_Bot is a Telegram bot powered by Stable Diffusion, a deep learning model developed by RunwayML. This bot uses a Colab notebook as its runtime environment and integrates with Telegram to provide text-based interaction. Users can send prompts to the bot, which generates responses using Stable Diffusion's language modeling capabilities.

## How It Works

The AML_Bot leverages the following technologies and components to function:

1. **Colab Notebook**: The bot is hosted and executed within a Colaboratory (Colab) notebook. Colab provides a cloud-based Python environment and allows seamless integration with external services like Telegram.

2. **Telegram Bot API**: AML_Bot utilizes the Telegram Bot API to interact with the Telegram messaging platform. To create the bot, we first registered it with BotFather, Telegram's official bot creation tool. BotFather provided us with a unique API token, which allows our bot to send and receive messages on Telegram.

3. **python-telegram-bot Library**: The `python-telegram-bot` library is a powerful Python wrapper for the Telegram Bot API. We use this library to handle the communication between our bot and Telegram. It provides convenient abstractions for handling commands, messages, and other bot functionalities.

4. **Stable Diffusion**: Stable Diffusion is a deep learning model provided by RunwayML that is capable of generating text based on given prompts. In this bot, we utilize Stable Diffusion's language modeling capabilities to generate responses to user prompts.

5. **Positive and Negative Prompts**: A user can interact with AML_Bot by sending positive or negative prompts. A positive prompt can be a request for generating a specific output, such as "Create a Batman poster with Joker in it." On the other hand, a negative prompt can specify the exclusion of certain elements, like "Create a Batman poster without the Joker, focusing on the hero's allies and achievements."

6. **Response Generation**: When a user sends a prompt to the bot, the bot uses the Stable Diffusion model to generate a response based on the given prompt. The model's responses are then sent back to the user through the Telegram messaging platform.

## How to Use AML_Bot

To interact with AML_Bot, follow these steps:

1. Open the Telegram app on your device or visit the Telegram web version.

2. Search for the AML_Bot username or bot name to find and start a conversation with the bot.

3. Once the conversation is initiated, you can send prompts to the bot. Use positive prompts to request specific outputs, and negative prompts to exclude certain elements.

4. AML_Bot will process your prompt using the Stable Diffusion model and generate a response based on the provided instructions.

5. The bot will send the generated response back to you through the Telegram messaging platform.

Please note that AML_Bot's responses are generated based on the capabilities and limitations of the Stable Diffusion model. The quality and accuracy of the responses may vary depending on the prompt and the underlying language model.

Feel free to experiment with different prompts and explore the capabilities of AML_Bot!
